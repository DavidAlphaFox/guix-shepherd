* Changes in version -0.4
** Awaken from a 10-year nap.
** Ported to Guile 2.0.
** Modules are modules instead of being loaded.
** Build system fixes, cleanups, and upgrades.

* Changes in version -0.5
** dmd: `--socket=-' instead of `--socket=none'.
** Renamed `extra-action' to plain `action'.
** The result of user-defined stop code is ignored now.
** New action for all services: `dmd-status'.
** Distribution contains file `QUESTIONS'.
** Improved the `unknown' service implementation in `examples/'.
** Number of args given to actions is verified.
** Made docstrings for actions optional.
** Renamed `{en,dis}able-persistency' to `{,no-}persistency'.
** Can pass file name to dmd action `persistency'.

* Changes in version -0.6
** New action `doc' for displaying documentation.
** `list-actions' is a sub-action of `doc' now.
** New action `cd' for dmd, useful with `--socket=none'.
** Distribution contains example for an `unknown' service.
** At configure time, dmd checks for a Guile installation.
** Enable readline on `--socket=none' and non-dumb terminal.
** Startup time finally became completely unacceptable. :-)

* Changes in version -0.7
** Can fork into background via dmd extra-action `daemonize'.
** New action for all services: list-actions.
** New options for dmd: --logfile (-l), and --silent/--quiet
** Standard option --usage works for both dmd and deco.
** You can pass relative file names to deco.
** Never send respawn-output to deco by accident.
** Better handling of terminals and similar services.
** Documented evolution of runlevels.
** Service groups can be used to start/stop services at once.
** Persistency (i.e. safe state on exit and restore next time).
** Invoke actions of service `unknown' (if defined) as fallback.
** Read commands from standard input if socket file name is `none'.

* Changes in version -0.8
** Show output in deco, not only in dmd.
** New options in deco: --insecure (-I) and --result-socket (-r)
** --help displays the options for both dmd and deco.
** Disable services which are respawning too fast.
** New actions for all services: enable, disable and enforce.
** Default extra actions work even when the service is stopped.
** Documented some internals of dmd.

* Changes in version -0.9
** Example configuration added.
** New option for deco: --socket (-s).
** New option for dmd: --insecure (-I).
** Added tutorial and completed documentation.
** Create default socket dir on startup if desired.
** Added a real build system.

* Changes in Version -0.9.6
** Controlling dmd completely with deco is now possible.
** A few bugfixes for service handling.
** Long options can be abbreviated, short ones also work.
** Respawning of services works.

* Changes in version -0.9.7
** User-defined code is always protected with a `catch'.
** New options: --config and --socket.
** The new deco program can be used to send commands to dmd.

* Changes in version -0.9.8
** Starting and stopping of services by symbol works better.
** Performing extra actions on services possible.
** Improved documentation.
** More detailed output.

* Version -0.9.9
** Initial release.
