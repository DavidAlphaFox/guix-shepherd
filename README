* An -*- outline -*- of the `dmd' service manager.

** What is `dmd'?

It is a service manager.  That is, on systems which are similar to
Unix (e.g. GNU/Linux), it is a replacement for the part of the `init'
program that manages runlevels and such.  On the GNU system, it is a
replacement for `/sbin/init', but not for `/hurd/init'.

** Requirements

This program requires Guile (the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language
for Extension), version 1.6.  It uses GOOPS, but as GOOPS is part of
Guile, a normal Guile installation is sufficient.

It is intended for use on GNU/Linux and GNU, but is likely to also
work elsewhere.

** Getting started

Despite the fact that this program is written in an interpreted
language, you can install this program like all programs that use
autoconf, but the recommended way in this case is:

  ./configure --prefix= --datadir=/usr/share
  make
  make install

Actually setting up `dmd' currently requires some work.  You should
read the Texinfo manual for details.

** More information

Detailed instructions on installing dmd are available in the file
`INSTALL'.  A list of user-visible changes between releases can be
found in the file `NEWS'.  Detailed information about changes on the
source code level are listed in `ChangeLog'.

A list of people who can be considered maintainers of this software is
available in the file `AUTHORS'.  A list of people who have been
helpful in improving dmd can be found in `THANKS'.

This program can be distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, version 2 or any later version, see the file `COPYING'
for details.  The Texinfo manual can be distributed under the terms of
the GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.1 or any later version,
see the file `COPYING.DOC' and the Texinfo manual (`dmd.texi' or any
file generated from it) for details.

** Bugs and Limitations

There is no localization done yet.

Code from the user configuration is allowed to mess up everything.

Runlevels do not work yet.

It is hard to setup currently.
