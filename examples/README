Example configurations for dmd
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This directory contains personal configuration files.  You can send me
your configuration too, and I will include it here, provided that it
is available under a license that makes it Free Software.

Hint: If you send my your configuration, then not only can other
people learn from it, but I can also make sure that I do not break
your code too often by making incompatible changes, and if I do it
anyway but notice it, I might tell you how to change the code to work
with a new version.
